cl-neo4j
----------------

Interface library for the Neo4J Graph Database API.

cl-neo4j is available under MIT License.
Written by Kevin Raison, forked by James Fleming.

Currently in alpha status, but will improve as I update the test suite.


Basic API
--------------

It largely mirrors the REST API as documented here: http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.5/rest-api.html
Authentication and the Transactional Cypher HTTP endpoint are new, but working.

Each function expects an argument `:request-handler <handler>` where the handler is an instance of `cl-neo4j:basic-handler`.
This object carries all attributes of the connection:

- hostname (default: localhost)
- port (default: 7474)
- protocol (default: https)
- dbuser (default: neo4j)
- dbpasswd (default: neo4j)

For a default local install, you'll only need to set the password on the server, and then invoke `(make-instance 'cl-neo4j:basic-handler :dbpasswd <new-password>)` to produce a suitable object.

The return values are alists of Neo4J results, from which you can extract the data you need.

Lispy Wrapper
--------------

cl-neo4j-wrapper has a higher level 'lispy' wrapper.

Tests
----------

Tests should clean up after themselves, but authors hold no warranty over corrupted data - use fresh testing database.

To run tests load cl-neo4j.tests system and run (cl-neo4j.tests:run-all-tests).
